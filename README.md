#“MRF” Model Release Form

MRF is a draft for a [model release](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_release) form enabling you to specify either general agreement (all photographs) or a per-photograph agreement.
The per-photograph agreement is based on [MD5 checksums](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Md5), the technical concept is described closer in [this article]().

We suggest that you contact a lawyer to discuss your circumstances, and verify that this Release fits your needs.*

##Open Application

The ease-of-use of such a release form could be improved by automating the checksum process via a mobile or server-side application.
One example of a *closed* source application doing something similar (sans picture specification) can be found [here](http://www.applicationgap.com/apps/easyrelease/#.U5QLJpHvYck).

Packaging the model release functionality in an interactive format would also allow easier selection of the precise rights being transferred.
We welcome any input on this front!
